# resonsiveSidebar

This is a simple responsive sidebar
I have used font-awesome "https://fontawesome.com/"
I connected the font awesome with the HTML file by using the kit "<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/820cc120bf.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>"
I have used the concept of toggle and specificity ":root" in the css
